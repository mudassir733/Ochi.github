Ochi Website Clone: Reimagining the User Experience

This repository holds the code for my clone of the Ochi website (Please note: this is not an official Ochi website). My goal was to create a reimagined version with an enhanced user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), along with captivating animations.

Key Highlights:

    Improved UI/UX: I've focused on refining the original design to provide a more intuitive and engaging user experience.
    Eye-catching Animations: Smooth and dynamic animations have been integrated to elevate the user journey.
    Clean and Maintainable Code: The code is well-structured and commented for readability and future modifications.

    Clone this repository.
    Install the required dependencies using npm install (or your preferred package manager).
